# Insertion-Sort
Sorting alogrithm

The commented part comprises of array values at each iteration, i just did it because i wanted to know how the values shift from one place to another. Otherwise those are of no use.
Run the exe file to run the program or compile it yourself using gcc commands.

The image has insertion sort example solved on paper alongside the algorithm.
